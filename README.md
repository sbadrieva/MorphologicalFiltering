# MorphologicalFiltering
Morphological Filters on Images 

Morphological filters such as dilate, erode, open, and close can be applied through image filtering. The aim of these filters is to grow or shrink image regions or to remove or fill-in image region boundary pixels. Operations such as dilate, erode , open and close can be used in many applications such as edge detection or boundary detection. In this repository, morphological edge and boundary detection is implemented.

The filters implemented in this class are top hat, bottom hat, morphological enhancement, morphological edge detection and morphological boundary detection.
